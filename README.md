# Student Final Grade Prediction

## Objective
To predict the final grade (G3) of Portuguese high school students using machine learning models based on demographic, social, and academic features.

## Problem Statement
Given a dataset of 396 Portuguese students, the goal is to classify whether a student will perform well in the final exam using machine learning models and evaluate their performance.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains student grades, demographics, social, and school-related attributes collected via reports and questionnaires. It includes data from two subjects: Mathematics and Portuguese language.

### Key Attributes:
- **Demographics:** Age, sex, address type (urban/rural), family size, parental education & job.
- **Academic Performance:** Grades (G1, G2, G3), past failures, study time, absences.
- **Social Factors:** Extra support, extracurricular activities, family relationship quality, free time, alcohol consumption, and more.

## Methodology
### Importance of Early Grade Prediction:
- Helps identify at-risk students early.
- Assists universities in improving retention and learning support.

### Data Visualization & Analysis:
- KDE, box plots, histograms, count plots.
- Analyzing correlations between student attributes and final grades.

## Machine Learning Models Used
- Linear Regression
- ElasticNet Regression
- Random Forest
- Extra Trees
- SVM (Support Vector Machine)
- Gradient Boosted Trees

## Experimental Results
### Visualizations:
- KDE plots, box plots, histograms for G3.
- Count plots for gender, age, and urban/rural students.

### Key Findings:
- Impact of past failures on G3.
- Influence of family education and support.
- Effect of social activities and study habits on final grades.
